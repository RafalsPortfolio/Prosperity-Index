# Project description
The project consists of the construction of a macroeconomic index, using a self-completed database. We carry it out in groups established in the Macroeconomics class. In a word whatever we consider relevant in terms of assessing how liveable a region is. At basis, we determine a weighted average of the normalised variables and create a ranking of the of the countries analysed.

# Proseprity-index
A total of 30 points can be awarded for a project. The pool of points consists of:
- Preparing the data in excel as required and making corrections in the notebook consisting, for example, of correcting the column type if necessary.
- Performing data normalisation.
- Determination of a weighted average.
- Presenting the five best and worst countries in the form of a summary table containing only the names of these countries and the values of the weighted averages.

# Results
Canada, the United States and Norway enjoy the highest levels of prosperity.
